#  Locust Load Testing Project

This project uses [Locust](https://locust.io/) to perform automated load testing on an API or web application.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Locust (`pip install locust`)
- Browser to view HTML reports
- Linux or WSL recommended for better performance

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Tests


### 1. Run in **browser** mode (with web UI)

```bash
locust -f tests/locustfile.py 

```
### 2. Run in **headless** mode (without web UI)

```bash
locust -f tests/locustfile.py --headless -u 50 -r 10 --host=https://httpbin.org -t 2m
```
### 3. Run in **headless** mode (no browser, ideal for CI/CD including reports directory and its files)

```bash
bash ./run_load_test.sh

```

## ðŸŽ¯ How to run distributed tests on a single machine

If you want to simulate a distributed Locust environment on a single computer, you can start a master and multiple workers in separate terminals.

### Start the master (machine or terminal 1) and the slaves (machine or terminal 2 and 3)

```bash
locust -f tests/locustfile.py --master

locust -f tests/locustfile.py --worker --master-host=127.0.0.1


Open the masterâ€™s web interface at http://localhost:8089
```
